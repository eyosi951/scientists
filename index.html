                <p class="text">Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity. 
                He is best known for his equation E=mc², which describes the equivalence of mass and enery
                Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, Einstein showed an early interest in mathematics and science. 
                His work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. 
                In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. 
                Einstein's contributions extend beyond physics; he was also an advocate for civil rights and pacifism. 
                He passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving a lasting legacy in both science and humanity.</p>

            <div class="img"><img src="newton.jpg" alt="image of sir Isaac Newton"></div>
                <p class="text">Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. 
            Born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, England, he made groundbreaking contributions to various fields of science. 
            Newton is best known for his laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics. 
            His work "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," published in 1687, is considered one of the most important scientific works ever written. 
            In addition to his work in physics, he made significant advancements in mathematics, including the development of calculus. 
            Newton also conducted experiments in optics, demonstrating that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors. 
                 He passed away on March 31, 1727, leaving a profound impact on science and mathematics that continues to influence modern thought.</p>

            <div class="img"><img src="plank.jpg" alt="image of Max Planck"></div>
                <p class="text">Max Planck was a German physicist who is best known for his role in the development of quantum theory. 
                    Born on April 23, 1858, in Kiel, Germany, Planck's work revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. 
                    In 1900, he introduced the concept of quantization of energy, proposing that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete units called quanta. 
                    This groundbreaking idea laid the foundation for modern physics and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. 
                    Planck's constant, a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, is named in his honor. 
                    Throughout his life, he faced numerous challenges, including the loss of family members during World War I and World War II. 
                    Planck passed away on October 4, 1947, leaving a lasting legacy in the field of physics and inspiring future generations of scientists.</p>
